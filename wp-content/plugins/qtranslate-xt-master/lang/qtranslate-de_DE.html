You may import and export compatible settings between %s and %s on Settings/<a href="%25s.html">Languages</a> configuration page. Then you have to deactivate one of the plugins to continue. %sImportant%s: Before you start making edits to post and pages, please, make sure that both, your front site and admin back-end, work under this configuration. It may help to review "%s" and see if any of conflicting plugins mentioned there are used here. While the current content, coming from %s, is compatible with this plugin, the newly modified posts and pages will be saved with a new square-bracket-only encoding, which has a number of advantages comparing to former %s encoding. However, the new encoding is not straightforwardly compatible with %s and you will need an additional step available under "%s" option if you ever decide to go back to %s. Even with this additional conversion step, the 3rd-party plugins custom-stored data will not be auto-converted, but manual editing will still work. That is why it is advisable to create a test-copy of your site before making any further changes. In case you encounter a problem, please give us a chance to improve %s, send the login information to the test-copy of your site to %s along with a detailed step-by-step description of what is not working, and continue using your main site with %s meanwhile. It would also help, if you share a success story as well, either on %sthe forum%s, or via the same e-mail as mentioned above.

Note that the multilingual content of posts, pages and other objects has not been altered during this operation. There is no additional operation needed to import content, since its format is compatible with %s. Applicable options have been exported to plugin %s. If you have done some post or page updates after migrating from %s, then "%s" operation is also required to convert the content to "dual language tag" style in order for plugin %s to function.

Be sure to make a full database backup before clicking one of the links. By default, all options are filtered to be translated at front-end for the sake of simplicity of configuration. However, for a developed site, this may cause a considerable performance degradation. Normally, there are very few options, which actually need a translation. You may simply list them above to minimize the performance impact, while still getting translations needed. Options names must match the field "%s" of table "%s" of WordPress database. A minimum common set of option, normally needed a translation, is already entered in the list above as a default example. Option names in the list may contain wildcard with symbol "%s". CSS code added by plugin in the head of front-end pages: CSS set: Cannot delete Default Language! Cannot disable Default Language! Cannot parse JSON code in the field "%s". Check this box and click Save Changes to reset all qTranslate settings. Choice "%s" disables this option and allows one to use its own custom CSS provided by other means. Choose CSS style for how Language Switching Buttons are rendered: Choose the corresponding country flag for language. (Example: gb.png) Choose the default language of your blog.

Dropdown Box Edit Edit Language Edit language cannot be switched without page re-loading. Try this mode, if some of the advanced translatable fields do not properly respond to the Language Switching Buttons due to incompatibility with a plugin, which severely alters the default WP behaviour. This mode is the most compatible with other themes and plugins. Editor Mode Editor Raw Mode Enable Enable function name compatibility (%s). Enabling a language will cause qTranslate to update the Gettext-Database for the language, which can take a while depending on your server's connection speed. Enter "%s" or "%s" attribute of text fields from your theme, which you wish to translate. This applies to post, page and media editors (%s). To lookup "%s" or "%s", right-click on the field in the post or the page editor and choose "%s". Look for an attribute of the field named "%s" or "%s". Enter it below, as many as you need, space- or comma-separated. After saving configuration, these fields will start responding to the language switching buttons, and you can enter different text for each language. The input fields of type %s will be parsed using %s syntax, while single line text fields will use %s syntax. If you need to override this behaviour, prepend prefix %s or %s to the name of the field to specify which syntax to use. For more information, read %sFAQ%s. Every multilingual field is expected to have a meaningful content in the "Default Language". Usually, it is the language of your site before it became multilingual.

I have already done it, dismiss this message. If a post type unchecked, no fields in a post of that type are treated as translatable on editing pages. However, the manual raw multilingual entries with language tags may still get translated in a usual way at front-end. If something isn't working correctly, you can always try to reset all qTranslate settings. A Reset won't delete any posts but will remove all settings (including all languages added). If you are updating from qTranslate 1.x or Polyglot, <a href="%25s.html">click here</a> to convert posts to the new language tag format. If you do not wish to customize this option, then reset it to the default by emptying its value. If you have installed qTranslate for the first time on a Wordpress with existing posts, you can either go through all your posts manually and save them in the correct language or <a href="%25s.html">click here</a> to mark all existing posts as written in the default language.

Anschlie√üend muss das nicht mehr ben√∂tigte Plugin deaktiviert werden. %sWichtig%s: Vor der Bearbeitung von Artikeln und Seiten muss sichergestellt sein, dass das Frontend und der Admin-Bereich mit dieser Konfiguration funktionieren. Hilfreich ist eventuell die Pr√ºfung, ob Plugins, die auf "%s" als problematisch gekennzeichnet sind, auf dieser WordPress-Installation im Einsatz sind.

In Zukunft werden jedoch die neu hinzugef√ºgten und ge√§nderten Artikel und Seiten im neuen Format gespeichert, das nur aus eckigen Klammern besteht und eine Vielzahl an Vorteilen im Vergleich zum alten %s-Format bietet.

Auch mit diesem zus√§tzlichen Schritt werden die benutzerdefinierten √úbersetzungen von Drittanbieter-Plugins nicht automatisch konvertiert, k√∂nnen jedoch manuell editiert werden. Aus diesem Grund wird die Erstellung einer Testkopie der Website empfohlen, bevor weiter √Ñnderungen gemacht werden.
